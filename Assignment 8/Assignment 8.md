I found the video [[Discrete Math 1] Euclidian Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOwyHTiW4KE) most helpful, as it relates to Assignment 6 directly. 
The video provides a straight definition of the algorithm, and an example that includes detailed step-by-step explantion.
The example shows clearly if a C++ GCD calculator were to be written, a recursion function would be very helpful since the algorithm repeats the division/modulus operations until there is no remainder.
There is also a proof of why this algorithm works, which helped with my curiousity.
