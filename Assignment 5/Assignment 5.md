Part 1:
```
Proove each of the following.  Indicate which proof method you are using and show your work.
```
- [ ]  Show that the square root of 2 is irrational.

Answer:
Assume sqrt(2) is rational, then it can be expressed as a rational fraction, b/a, where a and b are two relatively prime integers.
Therefore sqrt(2) = b/a => 2 = b^2/a^2 => b^2 = 2a^2.

- [ ]  If n = 25, 100, or 169, then n is a perfect square and is the sum of two perfect squares.

Answer: 
- [ ]  The sum of two odd integers is even.  Hint: By definition, even integers can be expressed as 2n, thus odd integers can be expressed as 2n + 1	

Answer: 
- [ ]  The sum of an even integer and it's square is even

Answer: 
- [ ]  If n squared is odd, then n is odd

Answer: 

Part 2:

- [ ] Prove by induction that 1 + 5 + 9 + ... + (4n-3) = n(2n-1)

Answer: 
- [ ] Prove that for any positive integer number n, n^3 + 2n is divisible by 3

Answer: 
- [ ] Prove that for n >= 1, 9^n âˆ’ 1 is divisible by 8 for all non-negative integers. 
Hint: 4^(3+1) = 4 * 4^3
Hint: If 9^n - 1 = 8m, then 9^n = 8m + 1
