# CIS 7 - Discrete Structures - Assignment 7

Write a program that prints out step-by-step instructions for completing the Tower of Hanoi.

Requirements:

- [ ] Asks the user for 1 integer indicating the number of disks to use.  Then have the program solve the Tower of Hanoi problem recursively.
- [ ] Have the program print out each move (for example: "Move disk from tower A to tower C")

If you are comfortable solving this using OOP, then:	
- [ ] Next have the program print out a visual representation of each tower in between moves.  For instance, after the first move, the console could show:
```
Tower A: -,2,3
Tower B: -,-,-
Tower C: -,-,1
Move disk 1 to Tower C
```	
- [ ] After each move, wait for user input and clear the screen

    If you are NOT comfortable solving this using OOP, then:
- [ ] Write another program that simply outputs the factorial of a given input
